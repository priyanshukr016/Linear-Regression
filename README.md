# Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model built using Python to predict a student’s placement package based on their CGPA. The dataset is loaded and analyzed using Pandas, numerical operations are handled with NumPy, and data visualization is done using Matplotlib. A scatter plot is used to understand the relationship between CGPA and package. The linear regression model learns this relationship and calculates the slope and intercept. Finally, the project allows users to input a CGPA value and get an estimated salary package. This beginner-friendly project helps understand data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning concepts.
